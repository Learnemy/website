+++
I started my career as a fresh grad entrepreneur, wanting to help people make a living with their passion. 

My startup journey took me through many challenges - from learning how to code when I couldn't find a tech co-founder, testing new ideas to grow the product, to moving to Silicon Valley for mentorship.

I've put my heart and soul into Learnemy but it eventually failed. Then I found a job at a startup and was fired 6 months after. 

Through resilience, a supportive community, and perhaps a sprinkle of dumb luck, I'm now the Developer Community Programs Manager at Facebook and the Founder of TechLadies.

At Facebook, I helped launch the [Developer Circles](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/) globally and scale it in Asia. Within a year, I've built communities to reach >60,000 developers, equipping them with education and employment opportunities.

Outside of Facebook, I work on [TechLadies](http://www.techladies.co/) - a community-led initiative for women in Asia to connect, learn, and grow in the tech industry. We are now a community reaching thousands, having taught hundreds of women programming skills, and helping tens of ladies enter the industry as software engineers.

I've spoken internationally at conferences such as [DevRelCon London (Keynote)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO66Y-501dc), [Campus Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHzXTVrGxj8), [PyCon Thailand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLwGJ3GyBxI), [International Women's Day by Jobs for New South Wales (Australia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZVAFrBzWKI&t=769s), Slush Singapore, [DevRel Summit](https://youtu.be/qgUd_S3jFn0?t=9524), [SRECon Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWnKqDl9Gcg), Seedstars Summit Asia, [MaGIC Academy Symposium](https://www.facebook.com/elishatan/posts/10155565809037597), and [RubyConf MY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSb7LLEgNY). I was also featured in [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/22/how-sharing-failure-stories-has-become-a-global-movement.html), [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/learning-website-founder-was-code-illiterate), [Her World](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155784288227597&set=picfp.633197596&type=3&theater), [e27](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/move-over-wonderwoman-techladies-creating-next-wave-female-091919850.html), [High Net Worth](http://www.hnworth.com/article/2017/10/06/stories-of-resilience-elisha-tan), and more.

I'm based in sunny Singapore and aspire to also be a standup comedian. â›±
