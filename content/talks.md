I enjoy sharing my experiences at events, conferences, and schools around the world. I've delivered keynote presentations, participated in panel discussions, and moderated panel discussions to an audience ranging from 20 to 350 people of diverse backgrounds. 

Invite me to speak at your next event on the following topics.

### Building developer communities

I've created a framework for companies and volunteers to build sustainable developer communities from scratch, and I can demonstrate how you can use this to design initiatives for developers.

I've spoken about this at [DevRelCon London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO66Y-501dc) (as a keynote speaker), [PyCon Thailand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLwGJ3GyBxI), [DevRel Summit](https://youtu.be/qgUd_S3jFn0?t=9524), [SRECon Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWnKqDl9Gcg), and [RubyConf MY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSb7LLEgNY).

### Tackling gender diversity in tech

Technology is meant to be accessible by all, it does not discriminate. I share why gender diversity is good for business and what we can do to make our industry more inclusive.

I've spoken about this at Seedstars Summit Asia, Google Women Techmakers, [CodingGirls Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isA6D9m7FpQ), and at [various TechLadies events.](https://engineers.sg/organization/techladies)

### Overcoming a startup failure

Failure is still a taboo subject. I believe that talking about failure help normalizes the experience and encourages people to take calculated risks.

I've shared my experiences at [IWD by Jobs for New South Wales (Australia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZVAFrBzWKI&t=769s), [Campus Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHzXTVrGxj8) , Startup Weekends (San Francisco & Penang), Slush Singapore, [Fuckup Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0CqGniuW2E)([Twice!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsX4WRxJWJg)), and [MaGIC Academy Symposium](https://www.facebook.com/elishatan/posts/10155565809037597).
